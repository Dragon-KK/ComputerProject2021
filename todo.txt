To do:

    The onCollision works for slower speeds but the logic just cant hold
    when the ball goes super fast it can effectively skip some walls
    this is because prevpos is updated after each wall check

    FIGURE OUT SOME NEW LOGIC FOR COLLISIONS
    
    THE BALL CAN PHASE OUT OF REALITY WHEN IT GOES WITH HIGH SPD

    if the ball calls a collision on two walls at a time it skips one of them (like when it goes with a high speed towards a corner)
    cause collision chekc is trash

    move ball stuff to physics
    work on player manager then set

    ///////////////////////////////////

    just need to work on player input

    create a player class
    create an inputmanager class

    use them in play.py, pong.py and entities.py
