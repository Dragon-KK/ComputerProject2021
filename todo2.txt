Entity is added as child
Entity tells sprite when to render
Sprite asks mesh how to render

Sprite has a position inbuilt
Entity can update the position of sprite
Mesh takes stuff from sprite


Mesh will take css values for positioning
Sprite contains absolute values
Entities will also use absolute values

Initial render is done using absolute values

Further rerenders can be done using absolute values too
